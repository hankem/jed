JED Wordstar mode notes

0.  To enable wordstar emulation, comment out the line in jed.rc loading
    emacs and edt bindings.  Then uncomment the line regarding wordstar
    bindings.
    
1.  The abort character is changed from ^G to ^^ (^6 on most keyboards).  
    This is necessary because ^G is bound to delete character in wordstar.
    
2.  I have implemented ^K, and ^Q keymaps.  I do not know bindings for other
    keymaps which is why they are not defined.  If there are any missing
    bindings and keymaps, please feel free to let me know and I will try to
    add them.
    
3.  Wordstar idea of block is preserved.  I have not changed its meaning as 
    emacs does.  However, note that wordstar's concept of a region is
    different from the concept that JED uses.  For this reason,  blocks in
    JED's wordstar mode are not highlighted.   Bug me if you want this
    changed.
  
4.  Since one of the keymaps is ^Q, it is up to the user to make sure that JED
    can receive the ^Q character.  This means that the user must make sure that
    ^Q is not used for flow control.  The alternative would be to use the 
    map_input function to map a different control character to ^Q.  See jed.txt
    for details.

5.  Finally, you might consider the native JED keybindings which are based
    on my experience using the Turbo Pascal editor.  To get an idea of these
    bindings, startup jed with no default init file as by using `jed -n'.
    Once in jed, press ESC-X and enter `describe_bindings' at the prompt.
    If you get lost, press ^H? for menus.
    
    Using the default JED bindings results in a faster startup of JED since
    there is no need to load any keybindings other than possible extensions
    to the default ones.
