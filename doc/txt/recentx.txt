Recently edited files
---------------------

The `recentx.sl' library file contains functions that enable jed to
maintain a cache of recently edited file names.  The older version,
`recent.sl' is deprecated.

recentx.sl adds the following additional menu entries to the the "File"
menu:

   Recent Files
   Recent Files by Ext

The "Recent Files" menu contains a list of the recently accessed
files.  The number displayed is configurable via the
`Recentx_Max_Files' variable.  The default is 15.

The "Recent Files by Ext" menu organizes recently accessed files by
extension.  The number per extension is also controlled by the
`Recentx_Max_Files' variable.

To enable this feature, add the following lines to your .jedrc file:

    require ("recentx");
    Recentx_Cache_Filename = ".jedrecent";
    Recentx_Max_Files = 15;     % The number of files per extension
    Recentx_Cache_Exclude_Patterns = {"^/tmp/", "\.tmp$"R};

The value of the Recentx_Cache_Exclude_Patterns variable is a list of
regular expressions that exclude the caching of filenames that match
any of the patterns.  In the above example, files with a ".tmp"
extension or are under the /tmp directory are excluded.
