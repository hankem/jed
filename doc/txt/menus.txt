This file documents the drop-down menu support in non-Windows versions
of jed.

Menu Activation and Navigation
------------------------------

The menus may be activated via the mouse, or by pressing the F10 key
or the ESC-m key.  Also, ESC + accelerator character may be used to
activate a particular menu-bar item, e.g. `ESC-f' to select the `File'
menu, provided that the particular editor emulation does not bind the
key to something else.  For example, Emacs uses ESC-f to move by
words.  See the discussion about `enable_menu_keys' below to work
around this problem.

The arrow keys or the mouse may be used to navigate the menus.  Use the
ENTER key to select a menu item.  To go back to a previous menu, press
either the ESC key or the backspace key.

Menu Colors
-----------

The colors of the menus may be controlled by the `set_color' strings:

   "menu"            Color of the menu bar
   "menu_popup"      Color of the popped-up menu window
   "menu_char"       Color of the keyboard-accelerator character
   "menu_selection"  Color of the current selection
   "menu_shadow"     Color of the popup-box shadow

Special Hints
-------------

To enable the mouse when running jed in an xterm, put the line

   enable_xmouse ();

in your .jedrc file.

To hide the menu bar, put

  enable_top_status_line (0);

in your .jedrc file.  This will hide the menu bar until it is
activated via a key such as F10.

Some terminals map the ALT key modifier to ESC + key.  For such
terminals, an item on the menu bar may be activated via the ALT key +
the accelerator key, e.g., `ALT-f' to select the file menu.

The main problem with hot-keys such as ESC-f is that certain modes
rebind these keys to other function.  To rebind these keys to the
menubar functions, put the line:

   enable_menu_keys ();

in your .jedrc file AFTER loading the appropriate editor emulation,
e.g., emacs.
