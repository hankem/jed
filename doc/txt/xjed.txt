These are some notes about using xjed, the X Window version of JED.  It also
mentions information about how to setup the EDT emulation under Linux.

xjed recognizes the following resources:

   Display    [d]    Display to run on
   Name              Instance name
   Geometry          Initial geometry specifications
   font              Default font to use
   background [bg]   Background color
   foreground [fg]   Forground color
   Title             name to be displayed on the title bar
   fgStatus   [sfg]  foreground color of the xjed buffer status line
   bgStatus   [sbg]  background color of the xjed buffer status line
   fgRegion   [rfg]  foreground color of a region as defined by point and mark
   bgRegion   [rbg]  background color of a region as defined by point and mark
   fgCursor   [cfg]  text cursor foreground color
   bgCursor   [cbg]  text cursor background color
   fgMouse    [mfg]  mouse cursor foreground color
   bgMouse    [mbg]  mouse cursor background color
   fgMenu     [fgm] Foreground color for menubar
   bgMenu     [bgm] Foreground color for menubar
   fgMessage  [fgms] Foreground color for messages
   bgMessage  [bgms] Background color for messages
   fgError    [fger] Foreground color for error messages
   bgError    [bger] Background color for messages
   
These resources specify color syntax highlighting options:

   fgOperator    [fgop]   forground color for operators (+, -, etc...)
   bgOperator    [bgop]   background color for operators
   fgNumber      [fgnm]   forground color for numbers
   bgNumber      [bgnm]   background color for numbers
   fgString      [fgst]   forground color for strings
   bgString      [bgst]   background color for strings
   fgComments    [fgco]   forground color for comments
   bgComments    [bgco]   background color for comments
   fgKeyword     [fgkw]   forground color for keywords
   bgKeyword     [bgkw]   background color for keywords
   fgKeyword1    [fgkw1]  forground color for keywords1
   bgKeyword1    [bgkw1]  background color for keywords1
   fgKeyword2    [fgkw2]  forground color for keywords2
   bgKeyword2    [bgkw2]  background color for keywords2
   fgDelimiter   [fgde]   forground color for delimeters
   bgDelimiter   [bgde]   background color for delimeters
   fgPreprocess  [fgpr]   forground color for preprocessor lines
   bgPreprocess  [bgpr]   background color for preprocessor lines

Any of the above items may be specified on the xjed command line. Quantities
enclosed in square brackets may be used as a shortform of their longer
counterparts.

For example, 

 xjed -d space:0.0 -font 9x15 -bg blue -fg white

will start xjed using the server on amy using a white on blue 9x15 font.

Once the X Window resource specifications have been parsed, any remaining
command line arguments are parsed as normal JED command line arguments.

The easiest way to specify the resources is to make use of a `.Xdefaults'
in your $HOME directory.  Here is an example entry for Xjed:

xjed*Geometry: 80x36+100+100
xjed*font: 10x20
xjed*background: white
xjed*foreground: black
xjed*fgNumber: blue

The first line specifies that the initial window size is 80 columns by 36
rows and that the top left corner of the window is to be positioned at (100,
100). The second line specifies a fixed 10x20 font.  The other two lines
specify the foreground and background colors of the window.

Delete Key:

   Once every month or two, someone sends me a patch for ``fixing''
the delete key.  The patch usually involves changing the escape
sequence associated with the DELETE keysym (0xFFFF) from "^?" to
"\e[3~".  The reason for the patch is to get the key labeled DELETE to
delete the character at the cursor and not the previous one.  However,
this solution creates as many problems as it solves because on many
systems, the BACKSPACE key also sends the DELETE keysym and the patch
would create havoc on such systems.  This is another manifestation of
the backspace vs delete debate.

   If you are sure that your X Windows server distinguishes between
the backspace key and the delete key, then you can get your delete key
to delete the character under the cursor by putting:

    x_set_keysym (0xFFFF, 0, "\e[3~");
    setkey ("delete_char_cmd", "\e[3~");

in your .jedrc file.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mouse Usage:

XJED S-Lang specific functions:

   x_set_window_name   :  Set the name of the window (for title bar)
   x_warp_pointer      :  Move mouse position to cursor position
   x_insert_cutbuffer  :  insert contents of system cut buffer in current
                          buffer
   x_copy_region_to_cutbuffer
                       :  insert a region in system cutbuffer
   x_set_keysym        :  define an equivalence string to be returned
                          when a function key is pressed.
			  
  also, set_color() may be used to set colors of mouse, cursor, normal,
  region, and status line as well as the colors used by the syntax
  highlighting routines.  For example,
  
      set_color ("mouse", "red", "blue");

  gives the mouse cursor a red forground with a blue background.  The color
  values must be recognizable by the X server.
  
  In addition to the usual keybindings, the X version binds:
  
     Control-UP     :  goto top of buffer
     Control-DOWN   :  goto end of buffer
     Shift-UP       :  move to top of window
     Shift-DOWN     :  move to bottom of window
     Control-RIGHT  :  Pan the window to the right
     Control-LEFT   :  Pan the window to the left
     Shift-RIGHT    :  skip to next word
     Shift-LEFT     :  skip to previous word
     
Miscellaneous:

   Suspending XJed is not allowed.  If ^Z is pressed, the window is raised
   if it is obscured, or lowered if it is totally visible.


EDT emulation under Linux.  

Angelo Pagan (pagan@astrpd.pd.astro.it) suggests putting 

	keycode 22  = Delete
	keycode 77  = KP_F1
	keycode 112 = KP_F2
	keycode 63  = KP_F3
	keycode 82  = KP_F4
	keycode 86  = KP_Separator

in the .Xmodmap file to enable EDT keypad emulation.
