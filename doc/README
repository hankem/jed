The main reason JED's version number is below 1.0 is due to the lack of
adequate documentation.  It is slowing being improved.

There are several sub-directories here including:

    txt/
    
       Many text files that describe various aspects of the editor are
       in this directory. They will eventually be stitched together
       and included in the manual.

    tm/
    
       This directory contains the text-macro source for the intrinsic
       functions.  In addition, it contains Guido Gonzato's quick
       reference guide for jed.

    manual/
       
       Eventually the jed manual will be put here.  Right now what is
       in there is old and is most likely out of date.
