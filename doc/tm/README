The .tm files in this directory form the source for documentation of
jed specific intrinsic functions and variables. The Makefile produces
documentation in a variety formats via SGML-Tools.

The documentation for the library functions (jed/lib/*.sl) are
actually in the .sl files themselves.  The documentation is stripped
via sl2tm and then processed via tm2txt.  Both these programs may be
found in the slang distribution (slang/doc/tm/tools/).

To produce .sgml files from the .tm source, you will need to install
the text-macro distribution.  See http://www.jedsoft.org/ for
availablity.
